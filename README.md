## Project Overview
This project is an **exploratory population health informatics research** investigating how **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)** are utilized to drive public health decision-making within the **Michigan State Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS)**.

The research seeks to explore the **real-world impact** of EHR systems on data sharing, disease monitoring, health trend surveillance, and public health intervention strategies. It emphasizes the **role of informatics in shaping health policy and operational practices** within public institutions.

## Objectives
1. **Assess** how EHR data are leveraged for decision-making in MDHHS.
2. **Examine** interoperability between EHR systems and other health information systems.
3. **Identify** challenges in EHR implementation and utilization.
4. **Explore** future opportunities, including AI integration and rural health coverage.

## Methodology
- **Literature Review**: Peer-reviewed articles, government reports, and HIT data from 2008â€“2024 were critically reviewed.
- **Case Study Analysis**: Focused on Michigan's MDHHS implementation of EHR tools for managing chronic diseases like hypertension.
- **Public Health Informatics Frameworks**: Applied to evaluate interoperability, data exchange, and usability.
  
- **Target Populations**:
  - MDHHS public health officials
  - Healthcare providers (physicians, nurses, midwives)
  - Epidemiologists and data analysts

### Impact on Public Health
- **Improved Data Exchange**: Seamless communication between federal, state, and local agencies.
- **Surveillance**: Enhanced monitoring of communicable diseases and chronic conditions.
- **Decision-Making**: Supports real-time, data-informed public health interventions.

### Challenges
- Variability in data formats hinders interoperability.
- Usability issues for frontline healthcare providers.
- Underrepresentation of rural populations in EHR datasets.
- Lack of standardized data for advanced analytics.

### Case Example: Hypertension Management in Michigan
- Training primary care providers in EHR usage improved chronic disease management.
- Controlled hypertension increased among patients whose providers used decision support tools (64% vs 56%).
